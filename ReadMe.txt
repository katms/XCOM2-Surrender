Adds an ability that causes all remaining soldiers to be captured. Panicked and concealed soldiers will be affected, as long as there is someone to activate the ability. This mod doesn't touch soldiers who are bleeing out, in vanilla they will die.

This mod has the option (disabled by default) to make this get-into-jail-free card less 100% guaranteed, with a configurable chance that ADVENT just kills them all instead.

If this is installed on a tactical save it probably won't show up until the next mission.

Mechanically, this just knocks everyone unconscious with no visualization, ending the mission, let me know if there's some edge case that isn't handled correctly.
