Adds an ability that causes all remaining soldiers to be captured. Panicked, stasised, and concealed soldiers will be affected, as long as there is someone to activate the ability. Has a chance to save soldiers who are bleeding out (normally they will die instead of being captured), increased chance of success based on how much time they have left.

This mod has the option (disabled by default) to make this get-into-jail-free card less 100% guaranteed, with a configurable chance that ADVENT just kills them all instead.

If this is installed on a tactical save it probably won't show up until the next mission.

Mechanically, this just knocks everyone unconscious with no visualization, ending the mission, let me know if there's some edge case that isn't handled correctly.
